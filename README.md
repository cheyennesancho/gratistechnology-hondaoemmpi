One of the company clients needed their multipoint inspection print out to be OEM
compliant, so I was provided with Hondaâ€™s OEM multipoint inspection document and
asked to create an identical document in HTML and CSS. Image 1 is the Honda OEM
multipoint I was provided with. Image 2 is the html document I created for the client. In
addition to developing the front end, I was also responsible for developing the back end
in terms of gather the data from techWall (Gratis Technology Software) and pushing the
data to the corresponding section on the document.
